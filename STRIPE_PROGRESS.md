## ⏳ Next Steps - Remaining Blocks

### Block D: Stripe Webhook ⏳ PENDING
**Priority: HIGH** - Needed to mark orders as paid in database

**Implementation needed:**
- [ ] Create `api/routes/stripe-webhook.js`
- [ ] Add webhook endpoint: `POST /api/stripe/webhook`
- [ ] Implement signature verification with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- [ ] Handle `checkout.session.completed` event
- [ ] Update orders table: `paid=true`, `paid_at=NOW()`, `payment_intent_id`
- [ ] Add raw body parser for webhook endpoint
- [ ] Test with Stripe CLI

**Files to modify:**
- `api/routes/stripe-webhook.js` (NEW)
- `api/server.js` (add webhook route)
- `api/middleware/rateLimiter.js` (webhook limiter)

### Block E: Admin Panel Updates ⏳ PENDING
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Show payment status in admin dashboard

**Implementation needed:**
- [ ] Add "Paid" filter dropdown: All / Paid / Unpaid
- [ ] Add paid status badge to order list
- [ ] Show paid_at timestamp in order details
- [ ] Color coding: green=paid, yellow=unpaid
- [ ] Update GET /api/orders to support paid filter
- [ ] Update AdminOrderDetail component

**Files to modify:**
- `src/pages/Admin.tsx`
- `src/components/AdminOrderDetail.tsx`
- `api/server.js` (orders endpoint)

---

## 🎯 Current Status

**What's working:**
- ✅ Complete payment flow: Step 8 → Stripe → Step 9 (Receipt)
- ✅ Payment details displayed correctly
- ✅ Clean receipt layout without form header
- ✅ Backend creates checkout sessions
- ✅ Frontend redirects properly

**What's missing:**
- ❌ Orders not marked as "paid" in database after payment
- ❌ Admin panel doesn't show payment status
- ❌ No webhook to update payment status

---

## 🚀 Next Action: Block D (Webhook)

**Why this is critical:**
- Without webhook, orders stay "unpaid" in database
- Admin panel can't distinguish paid vs unpaid orders
- Payment status never gets updated

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes

**Testing approach:**
1. Use Stripe CLI to forward webhooks locally
2. Test with test payment
3. Verify database updates
4. Deploy and test on Railway

## 📋 Environment Variables Status

**Railway Variables (All Set):**
- ✅ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- ✅ `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` 
- ✅ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- ✅ `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`
- ✅ `FRONTEND_URL`

**Database Schema (Ready):**
- ✅ `orders.paid` BOOLEAN
- ✅ `orders.paid_at` TIMESTAMPTZ
- ✅ `orders.payment_intent_id` VARCHAR
- ✅ `orders.stripe_checkout_session_id` VARCHAR

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If webhook implementation breaks anything:
1. Remove webhook route from `api/server.js`
2. Redeploy backend
3. Payment flow still works (just no database updates)
4. Can implement webhook later
