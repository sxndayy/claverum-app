# Redirects - ensure trailing slash consistency
# Redirect paths without trailing slash (and without file extensions) to paths with trailing slash
# This ensures canonical URLs are consistent

# WWW to Non-WWW redirects - ensure canonical domain

# 2. /blog/hauskauf-beratung/index.html will be served directly

# SPA fallback - must be last to handle all other routes
# IMPORTANT: Netlify serves static files BEFORE redirects
# With pretty_urls = true, /path/index.html is automatically served as /path/
# This redirect only applies if no static file exists for the path
