# This ensures the blog route is properly prerendered for SEO

# Redirects - ensure trailing slash consistency
# Redirect paths without trailing slash (and without file extensions) to paths with trailing slash
# This ensures canonical URLs are consistent

# WWW to Non-WWW redirects - ensure canonical domain
