# IMPORTANT: Netlify serves static files BEFORE redirects
# With pretty_urls = true, /path/index.html is automatically served as /path/
# Static HTML files generated by prerender.js (e.g., /stuttgart/index.html, /leipzig/index.html)
# will be served directly without hitting the SPA fallback below
# This SPA fallback only applies if no static file exists for the path

# SPA fallback - must be last
